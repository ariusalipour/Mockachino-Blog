It's going to be an exciting time for me this year as I will be going to the IWA Outdoor Classics as myself. This means that I have no obligations to do media coverage for any other media entity. It also means that I will not have any standing that I used to have from well established media entities.

I'm honestly curious how I will be received by brands but I am hopeful that the work I've done previously and my personality will help create a fresh start where I have nothing to currently give to these brands.

I'm going to do my best to cover what I think is going to be most relevant to the UK market, but also cover the odd product that isn't available but is of interest. Let's see how it goes this year.

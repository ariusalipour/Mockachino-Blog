I'm happy to say that I survived my trip to IWA 2025. That is all!

I'm kidding, of course. IWA 2025 was a great opportunity for me to try and push myself to create content for myself. It's not as easy as doing it for others as it required me to think on my own and try to remove any anxieties I have.

I'm happy to say that I did it. I managed to create content that I'm happy with and I'm looking forward to doing more of it in the future. I'm not sure what the future holds for me, but I'm sure it will be interesting.

I have noticed that my subscriber count has doubled on YouTube and I'm happy to see that people are interested in what I have created. I'm not sure if I will be able to keep up with the demand, but I'm going to try my best.

You can find all my content on my social media channels and on the website.

Hello there! I'm a competition shooter in both handgun and rifle disciplines, and I'm a big tech and gaming enthusiast. Whether it's the latest FPS or RTS game, or the newest tech gadgets and software, I'm always eager to learn more and stay ahead of the curve.

I'm not afraid to dive deep into specs and offer my opinions on what works best for me. I like to keep things fun and light-hearted, so expect the occasional joke or quip. Thanks for checking out my site, and I hope you enjoy what you find here!
